# Web Design I - Final - Art Department - Queens College - Spring 2019

— **Before you start, read these instructions over multiple times.**  
— **Do not clone/download this repo — first fork it, *then* clone your fork.**

For your final project, you are to implement a web site rendition of the designs you created for the midterm. This web site should be a full implementation of your midterm designs, complete with working links, valid content, and responsive versions of all pages.

## 🧹 Validators/Linters
The two code-checking tools for Atom (`w3c-validation` and `linter-stylelint`) that you used for the semester project are also needed for this project.

### HTML (`w3c-validation`)
1. Launch Atom.
2. Go to `Settings` | `Install`.
3. Search for `w3c-validation`.
4. If you see a blue **Install** button, then install the plug-in. Otherwise, it’s installed and you may skip the next step.
5. Restart Atom.

### CSS (`linter-stylelint`)
1. Launch Atom.
2. Go to `Settings` | `Install`.
3. Search for `linter-stylelint`.
4. If you see a blue **Install** button, then install the plug-in. Otherwise, it’s installed and you may skip the next step.
5. Restart Atom.

## 📋 Instructions
* All CSS in the `css` folder.
* All image files in the `img` folder.
* All JavaScript, if applicable, in the `js` folder.
* 🚫 No image file should be larger than 1MB.
* 🚫 Do not alter the file/folder structure of the scaffold. Just add to it.
* Only submit files that are required by your project: 🚫 Do not submit working files, such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.indd`, or `.sketch` files.
* Use lower-case, combined with kebab-case, to name folders and files (`do-this` or `do-this.html`); 🚫 no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); 🚫 no camel case (`notThis`); and, 🚫 no snake case (`not_this`).

## 📝 Grading

|-----------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------:|
| **Adherence to midterm designs**                          | `20`                                      |
| **Scaffold tampering**                                    | `20`                                      |
| **Responsive implementation of web site**                 | `20`                                      |
| **Files not required by project**                         | `10`                                      |
| **Correct scaffold**                                      | `10`                                      |
| **Presentation for critique**                             | `10`                                      |
| **Images larger than 1MB**                                | `10`                                      |
| **HTML error**                                            | `1` penalty point per error (max of `50`) |
| **CSS error**                                             | `1` penalty point per error (max of `50`) |
| **Extra credit**                                          | Varies, depending on penalty points       |

Note that HTML and CSS errors over-ride the cumulative nature of the grading scheme above. For example, if you scored a total grade of 100, but your code generated 20 errors in HTML and CSS, then your final grade would be 80.

On the other hand, if you scored 100 and your project generated **no** errors, then you’ve earned 20 points of extra credit, which would be applied to your **midterm** grade.
